Describe the image style, e.g. any photographic or art styles / techniques utilized. Make sure to fully describe all aspects of the cinematography, with abundant technical details and visual descriptions. If there is more than one image, combine the elements and characters from all of the images creatively into a single cohesive composition with a single background, inventing an interaction between the characters. Be creative in combining the characters into a single cohesive scene. Focus on two primary characters (or one) and describe an interesting interaction between them, such as a hug, a kiss, a fight, giving an object, an emotional reaction / interaction. If there is more than one background in the images, pick the most appropriate one. Your output is only the caption itself, no comments or extra formatting. The caption is in a single long paragraph. If you feel the images are inappropriate, invent a new scene / characters inspired by these. Additionally, incorporate a specific movie director's visual style (e.g. Wes Anderson, Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino) and describe the lighting setup in detail, including the type, color, and placement of light sources to create the desired mood and atmosphere.

Title: {"Use the title '" + custom_title + "'" if poster and custom_title else "A catchy, intriguing title that captures the essence of the scene"}, place the title in "".
Main character: Give a description of the main character.
Background: Describe the background in detail.
Supporting characters: Describe the supporting characters
Branding type: Describe the branding type
Tagline: Include a tagline that captures the essence of the movie.
Visual style: Ensure that the visual style fits the branding type and tagline.
You are allowed to make up film and branding names, and do them like 80's, 90's or modern movie posters.

Output should NEVER be markdown or include any formatting.
NEVER ADD ANY HGAPPY TALK IN THE PROMPT
Add how the title should look and state that its the main title.
Here is an example of a prompt, make the output like a movie poster: 
Title: Display the title "Verdant Spirits" in elegant and ethereal text, placed centrally at the top of the poster.

Main Character: Depict a serene and enchantingly beautiful woman with an aura of nature, her face partly adorned and encased with vibrant green foliage and delicate floral arrangements. She exudes an ethereal and mystical presence.

Background: The background should feature a dreamlike enchanted forest with lush greenery, vibrant flowers, and an ethereal glow emanating from the foliage. The scene should feel magical and otherworldly, suggesting a hidden world within nature.

Supporting Characters: Add an enigmatic skeletal figure entwined with glowing, bioluminescent leaves and plants, subtly blending with the dark, verdant background. This figure should evoke a sense of ancient wisdom and mysterious energy.

Studio Ghibli Branding: Incorporate the Studio Ghibli logo at the bottom center of the poster to establish it as an official Ghibli film.

Tagline: Include a tagline that reads: "Where Nature's Secrets Come to Life" prominently on the poster.

Visual Style: Ensure the overall visual style is consistent with Studio Ghibli s signature look   rich, detailed backgrounds, and characters imbued with a touch of whimsy and mystery. The colors should be lush and inviting, with an emphasis on the enchanting and mystical aspects of nature."""
