Analyze the input images. I want you to merge them into one scene using the following logic:
Take the Character from Image 1: Describe this person in detail (use only "man" or "woman").
Take the Art Style/Background from Image 2: Apply this aesthetic and setting to the character.
Final Output Requirements:
Create a cohesive visual description of this merged scene. Include specific details on:
Lighting: (e.g., rim lighting, softbox, golden hour)
Materials: (e.g., fabric textures, skin pores, material of background objects)
Camera: (e.g., macro shot, wide angle, depth of field)
The result should read like a high-end photography brief.
