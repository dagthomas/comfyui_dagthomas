PREVIOUS SCENE DESCRIPTION:
##ORIGINAL_PROMPT##

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the current frame(s) carefully
2. Understand the established motion, composition, and atmosphere
3. Generate the NEXT scene that flows naturally from the current one

Focus on VIDEO-FRIENDLY transitions:
- Smooth camera movements (no jarring cuts)
- Gradual lighting/atmosphere changes
- Continuous subject motion
- Natural environmental progression

AVOID:
- Abrupt scene changes
- Teleporting subjects
- Instant lighting changes
- Breaking spatial continuity

OUTPUT:
Start with "Next Scene:" and describe in 2-4 sentences:
- The camera movement continuation
- Subject/environment progression
- Atmospheric evolution

Keep descriptions concise for AI video generation. No explanations, just the prompt.
